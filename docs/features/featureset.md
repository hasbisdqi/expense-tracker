### 6. Data Management

Accessible via **Settings → Data Management** (dedicated sub-screen). The page is organised into three cards:

1. **Encryption** — passphrase setup and management (required before any backup)
2. **Backup** — reminders, Google Drive status, and backup creation
3. **Import & Export** — raw data dump (export) and restore (import)

#### End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

All backups are always end-to-end encrypted. No unencrypted backup file ever leaves the device.

- **Algorithm**: AES-GCM 256-bit with PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation (600,000 iterations)
- **Implementation**: Pure [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) — zero additional packages
- **Passphrase storage**: Stored locally in IndexedDB via `idb-keyval`; never transmitted anywhere
- **Encrypted file format**: `.extrack` — a self-describing JSON envelope:
  ```json
  {
    "format": "extrack-encrypted-backup",
    "version": "1",
    "algorithm": "AES-GCM",
    "kdf": "PBKDF2-SHA256",
    "iterations": 600000,
    "salt": "<base64url-16bytes>",
    "iv": "<base64url-12bytes>",
    "ciphertext": "<base64url>"
  }
  ```
- **Forward compatibility**: iterations are stored per-file so future algorithm upgrades don't break old files
- **Passphrase UX** (Encryption card):
  - **Unset state**: shows `Passphrase: Unset` with a "Set Passphrase" button; clicking opens the setup modal
  - **Set state**: shows masked `●●●●●●●●●●●●` with an Eye icon (reveal) and Pencil icon (change)
  - **Change flow**: two-step — warning dialog (old files won't be re-encrypted) → new passphrase form
  - **Minimum length**: 8 characters
- **Backup gate**: attempting to create a backup without a passphrase opens the setup modal first; on completion, the backup dialog opens automatically
- **Factory reset**: clears the stored passphrase along with all other data

#### Backup

- **Always encrypted** — backups are written as `.extrack` files; no plaintext backup pathway exists
- **Save to device** or **Google Drive** (when connected)
- **Drive not connected**: shows a "Connect Drive" button that starts the OAuth flow inline — no separate settings screen required
- **Filename convention**: `extrack-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.extrack`
- **Duplicate handling**: backing up to Drive on the same day replaces the existing file (no duplicates)
- **Tracks last backup**: records date and destination (Device / Google Drive) for use in reminder display

#### Export Data

- **Device-only** — no Drive option; purely a data dump, not reminder-tracked
- **Format options**: JSON or CSV
- **Optional encryption**: "Encrypt this export" checkbox (default unchecked)
  - When checked: encrypts content (regardless of format) and saves as `.extrack`
  - When checked and no passphrase set: opens passphrase setup inline before saving
  - When unchecked: saves as plain `.json` or `.csv` as before
- **Always exports all data** — no date range filtering
- **JSON export** includes full expense data, category definitions, and export metadata
- **CSV export** with columns: Date, Time, Category, Description, Value, Tags, IsAdhoc, Attachment
- **Filename conventions**:
  - Unencrypted: `extrack-export-YYYY-MM-DD.json` / `.csv`
  - Encrypted: `extrack-export-YYYY-MM-DD.extrack`

#### Google Drive Backup

- **Optional cloud backup** via Google Drive — no backend, fully client-side
- **PKCE OAuth 2.0** authentication with real refresh tokens (no repeated logins)
- **Auto-creates `ExTrack Backups` folder** in the user's Drive on first backup
- **Token auto-refresh**: access token silently refreshed before each upload; no popup for logged-in users
- **Inline account management** inside the Backup card:
  - Connected state: shows account email and folder name (`ExTrack Backups`) with an **Unlink** button
  - Disconnected state: shows a **Connect** button that starts the OAuth flow
  - Disconnecting revokes the token and clears credentials locally; Drive files are not deleted
- **Scope**: `drive.file` — app can only access files it created, not any other Drive content
- **No API key required** — all Drive calls use the user's OAuth access token only
- **"View in Drive ↗"** action in success toast after each cloud backup

#### Backup Reminders

- **User-configurable frequency**: Never / Daily / Weekly / Monthly
- Shown once per qualifying day; records last-shown and last-backup timestamps
- **Last backup display**: shows date, days elapsed, and destination — e.g. "Last backed up: 3 days ago · Device" or "Last backed up: today · Google Drive"
- **Startup prompt**: non-intrusive banner when a reminder is due; **"Backup Now"** opens the Backup dialog directly
- **Frequency setting** is in the Backup card on Settings → Data Management

#### Import

- **`.extrack` files only** — only encrypted backup files can be imported (plain JSON exports are not importable)
- **Auto-decrypt**: if a passphrase is stored, decryption happens silently on file selection
- **Manual passphrase fallback**: if no passphrase is stored (new device) or auto-decrypt fails, a passphrase input is shown; the file stays loaded so the user can retry without re-selecting
- **Wrong passphrase detection**: AES-GCM authentication tag failure maps to a clear "Wrong passphrase — try again" error
- **CSV export guard**: encrypted CSV exports show an error ("This file is an encrypted export, not a restorable backup") and are rejected
- **Two merge modes** (Override is default):
  - **Override**: Replace all existing data
  - **Merge**: Add to existing data, skip duplicates
- **Import preview**: Shows expense count, category count, date range
- **File size cap**: 10 MB limit enforced before the file is read into memory
- **Validation**: Checks encrypted envelope structure and backup JSON shape before import

#### Clear All Data

- **Complete data wipe**: Expenses, categories, tags, settings, encryption passphrase
- **Re-seeding**: Restores default categories
- **Confirmation dialog** with clear warnings
- **Full storage cleanup**: clears IndexedDB (Dexie) and idb-keyval store for a fresh start

### 14. Data Privacy & Security

Complete local data management with end-to-end encryption:

- **No backend server**: All data stays on device (or user's own Google Drive)
- **End-to-end encryption**: Backups are always encrypted with AES-GCM 256 before leaving the device — not even a Google Drive admin can read them
- **Zero-knowledge design**: The passphrase is stored only in the user's own IndexedDB; it is never transmitted, logged, or accessible to anyone else
- **Strong key derivation**: PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations makes brute-force attacks computationally infeasible
- **Pure Web Crypto API**: Encryption uses the browser's native cryptography primitives — no third-party crypto library is bundled
- **Self-describing encrypted files**: The `.extrack` format stores algorithm parameters per-file, enabling future algorithm upgrades without breaking old backups
- **IndexedDB storage**: Persistent local database
- **No analytics**: Zero tracking or telemetry
- **No user accounts**: No registration required
- **CORS isolation**: Data never transmitted to any third party
- **Google Drive integration**: OAuth tokens stored in IndexedDB, scoped to `drive.file` only; tokens never logged or sent anywhere except `googleapis.com`
- **Open source**: Transparent codebase (MIT license)
