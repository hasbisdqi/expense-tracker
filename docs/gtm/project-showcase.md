## 😤 The Problem With Every Other Expense App

You open the App Store. You find a nice expense tracker. You tap install.

Then it asks you to **create an account**. Fine. Then it wants access to your contacts "to help you split bills." Sure. Then there are ads between every swipe. Oh, and the premium tier is $8/month to unlock CSV export. And six months later you find out they sold your spending patterns to a data broker.

**Sound familiar?**

> Most expense apps treat _you_ as the product. Your spending habits are valuable data, and they know it.

ExTrack does exactly none of that.

- ❌ No account required : not even an email address
- ❌ No server : there is no backend. Literally.
- ❌ No ads, no trackers, no telemetry whatsoever
- ❌ No App Store or Play Store needed
- ✅ All your data lives in **your** browser, on **your** device, under **your** control

---

## 🎬 Key Experiences

### 1 : ⚡ Logging Expenses & Organising With Categories + Tags

<!-- 🎥 Video: Logging flow (exp1.mp4) -->
<div style="max-width:400px;margin:12px auto;">
  <video controls muted loop style="width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:0 6px 18px rgba(4,7,12,0.15);">
    <source src="./assets/exp1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag. Download the video: <a href="./assets/exp1.mp4">exp1.mp4</a>
  </video>
</div>

Logging an expense takes **under 10 seconds** : and ExTrack actively helps you do it faster every time.

| Feature                      | What it does                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description autocomplete** | Suggests past expense descriptions as you type (fuzzy matching, top 10 results)  |
| **Tag suggestions**          | Frequency-ranked suggestions filtered to what you haven't added yet              |
| **Category quick-create**    | Create a new category without leaving the expense form                           |
| **Smart defaults**           | Pre-fills current date & time; remembers your most-used categories               |
| **Receipt photos**           | Attach a photo directly from your camera or gallery (compressed, stored locally) |

**Categories** are fully yours : pick from 100+ Lucide icons, choose any of 36 hand-picked colours, and name them whatever makes sense to you. **Tags** come with their own stats: how many expenses use each tag, when it was last used, and bulk rename/delete across all expenses.

Up to **4 tags per expense** keeps things organised without turning into chaos.

### 2 : 📊 Analysis, Charts & Spending Trends

<!-- 🎥 GIF: Analysis flow : Navigate to the Analysis tab. Show the period selector (Week → Month → Year). Navigate forward/backward with the arrows while watching the pie chart update live. Tap a pie segment to highlight it in the legend. Switch to Bar chart view. Scroll down to the Spending Trend section : show the line chart animating. Toggle the "Exclude ad-hoc expenses" switch and watch the totals update. Tap the Export button and show the CSV/JSON options. -->

<div style="max-width:400px;margin:12px auto;">
  <video controls muted loop style="width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:0 6px 18px rgba(4,7,12,0.15);">
    <source src="./assets/exp2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag. Download the video: <a href="./assets/exp2.mp4">exp2.mp4</a>
  </video>
</div>

The Analysis page turns your raw spending data into a **story you can actually understand**.

#### Period Selection & Navigation

Choose **Week**, **Month**, **Year**, or a **Custom date range**. Use the ← → arrows to navigate through time : watch your charts update live as you move between periods.

#### Category Breakdown

- 🥧 **Pie chart** : instant visual split of where money went
- 📊 **Bar chart** : compare categories side by side
- Percentage distribution, total amount, and transaction count per category
- Click any segment to highlight it

#### Spending Trend

- 📈 **Line chart** with smart granularity : shows daily data for a week, weekly for a month, monthly for a year
- See exactly when in the month you tend to overspend

#### Summary Metrics

**Total spend · Transaction count · Average expense · Top category** : all at a glance, updating with your period selection.

#### Ad-hoc Expense Toggle

Mark one-off purchases (gifts, medical emergencies, flights) as **ad-hoc** at logging time. Toggle them out of the analysis view to see your _regular_ spending baseline : not a distorted snapshot from that trip to the dentist.

#### Export Directly From Analysis

Hit **Export** right from the analysis view : get a CSV or JSON of the filtered data you're looking at.

### 3 : 🔐 E2EE Backup via Google Drive & Restore on Any Device

<div style="max-width:400px;margin:12px auto;">
  <video controls muted loop style="width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:0 6px 18px rgba(4,7,12,0.15);">
    <source src="./assets/exp3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag. Download the video: <a href="./assets/exp3.mp4">exp3.mp4</a>
  </video>
</div>

This is the feature that makes ExTrack genuinely special.

**Your backups are encrypted before they ever leave your device.** Not "encrypted in transit." Not "encrypted at rest on our servers." Encrypted _in your browser_, using your passphrase, before the file is written anywhere. Not even a Google employee, or us can read it.

#### The Encryption Stack

| Component              | Detail                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cipher**             | AES-GCM 256-bit (authenticated encryption : tampering is detected)                                                                       |
| **Key derivation**     | PBKDF2-SHA256 with **600,000 iterations** (brute-force infeasible)                                                                       |
| **Implementation**     | Pure browser-native [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) : zero third-party crypto packages |
| **Passphrase storage** | Stored only in _your_ IndexedDB; never transmitted, logged, or accessible to anyone else                                                 |

#### The `.extrack` File Format

Every backup is saved as a `.extrack` file, a self-describing JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "format": "extrack-encrypted-backup",
  "version": "1",
  "algorithm": "AES-GCM",
  "kdf": "PBKDF2-SHA256",
  "iterations": 600000,
  "salt": "<base64url : 16 bytes>",
  "iv": "<base64url : 12 bytes>",
  "ciphertext": "<base64url>"
}
```

Algorithm parameters are stored _per file_ so future upgrades never break your old backups.

#### Google Drive Integration (No Backend Required)

- **PKCE OAuth 2.0** : the login is between you and Google. ExTrack never sees your Google credentials.
- Scope: **`drive.file` only** : the app can only access files it created, nothing else in your Drive
- Auto-creates an `ExTrack Backups` folder on first use
- Same-day backups replace the previous file (no duplicates building up)
- **Access tokens auto-refresh silently** : no repeated login prompts
- Unlink at any time; your Drive files are not deleted

#### Restore on Any Device

Move to a new phone? Reinstall the app? Just:

1. Import your `.extrack` file
2. Enter your passphrase (auto-filled if stored on this device)
3. Preview: _"312 expenses, 8 categories, Jan 2025 → Mar 2026"_
4. Choose **Override** (replace everything) or **Merge** (add to existing data, skip duplicates)
5. Done. Your data is back.

### 4 : 📱 Install as a PWA : No App Store. No Play Store. Just a Browser.

<!-- 🎥 GIF: PWA install flow : On mobile Chrome (Android): open https://extrack.madhukm.com, show the "Add to Home Screen" / install banner appearing. Tap Install. Watch the app icon appear on the home screen. Launch it from the home screen : show it opens in standalone mode (no browser chrome). Go offline (enable airplane mode), refresh : app still works perfectly. On desktop Chrome: show the install icon in the address bar, click it, the app opens as a standalone window. -->

<div style="max-width:400px;margin:12px auto;">
  <video controls muted loop style="width:100%;height:auto;border-radius:8px;box-shadow:0 6px 18px rgba(4,7,12,0.15);">
    <source src="./assets/exp4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag. Download the video: <a href="./assets/exp4.mp4">exp4.mp4</a>
  </video>
</div>

ExTrack is a **Progressive Web App** : which means it installs and runs like a native app without going anywhere near an app store.

| Platform                     | How to install                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Android (Chrome)**         | Tap the "Add to Home Screen" banner or the install icon in the browser menu |
| **iOS (Safari)**             | Tap Share → "Add to Home Screen"                                            |
| **Desktop (Chrome / Edge)**  | Click the install icon in the address bar                                   |
| **Any other modern browser** | Works perfectly as a browser tab : install is optional                      |

**Why this is a big deal:**

- 🚫 No App Store review process : updates ship the moment they're deployed
- 🚫 No Play Store : no region restrictions, no approval delays
- ✅ Works offline immediately after first load (Service Worker + Workbox caches everything)
- ✅ Launches in standalone mode : looks and feels like a native app
- ✅ When a new version ships, a non-intrusive "Update available" banner appears : tap to reload

> **"If it has a modern browser, it runs ExTrack."**
> Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge : on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux. All of them.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security: The Full Picture

ExTrack was designed from the ground up around one principle: **your financial data is yours alone**.

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture

| Claim             | Reality                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No backend server | The app is pure static HTML/JS/CSS. There is no API, no database, no server to hack.                                                       |
| No accounts       | You never create a username or password with us. There's nothing to breach.                                                                |
| No telemetry      | Zero analytics, zero crash reporting, zero "anonymous usage data." Nothing is sent anywhere.                                               |
| No ads            | The app is open source and MIT licensed. There is no business model that monetises you.                                                    |
| IndexedDB storage | All expenses, categories, tags, and settings live in your browser's local IndexedDB. Clearing site data wipes it; you are in full control. |

### Backup Security In Depth

- **Backups are always encrypted** — the `.extrack` backup pathway has no plaintext option. Every backup file is encrypted in your browser before it is saved anywhere.
- **Exports are plaintext by choice** — the separate Export feature (CSV / JSON) gives you your raw data with no strings attached. It's your data, and you can take it wherever you want. Encryption is available as an opt-in for exports, but never forced.
- **AES-GCM is authenticated** : if anyone tampers with the file, decryption fails. You'll know.
- **600,000 PBKDF2 iterations** : at modern GPU speeds, brute-forcing a strong passphrase would take thousands of years.
- **The Web Crypto API is browser-native** : no third-party library means no supply-chain risk. The same crypto engine that banks use.
- **Google Drive scope is `drive.file`** : the app can only see files it created. It cannot browse or read any other file in your Drive.
- **OAuth tokens never leave your device** : stored in IndexedDB, only used for authenticated Drive API calls over HTTPS to `googleapis.com`.

### Data Lifecycle

- **Factory Reset** : one button wipes expenses, categories, tags, settings, passphrase, and OAuth tokens. IndexedDB is cleared completely. Default categories are re-seeded. A fresh start.

## 🌍 True Cross-Platform Freedom

Most apps are prisoners of their platform. iOS apps need App Store approval. Android apps need Play Store review. Desktop apps need installers and admin rights.

**ExTrack has none of those constraints.**

```
iOS Safari  ✅     Android Chrome ✅     Desktop Chrome ✅
Firefox     ✅     Safari macOS   ✅     Edge           ✅
```

Any device. Any OS. Any browser. Open `https://extrack.madhukm.com` and you're running the full app : no download, no install, no permission prompt from an app store gatekeeper.

Install it as a PWA in 10 seconds for the native-app experience. Or keep it as a browser tab. Either way, **all features work**, **offline works**, and your data never leaves the device.

When we ship an update, it goes live immediately : no waiting for App Store review, no forcing users to update, no version fragmentation. Everyone gets the latest version automatically.
